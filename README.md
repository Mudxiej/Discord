# Hi, I'm Mudxiej_!
----
If you are reading this you are probably wondering why do I have it connected to my Discord.
> Well, it's because Discord has a 190 characters limit in the description, so to tell a little bit more about me - I'm creating a GitHub page about it.
> I know there might be a better way to show this, but I don't know any, so hook me up if there is :DD

## About my "_in real life_" side
I'm Oskar, I'm 19 years old, and I'm Polish :)) :poland:

I'm around 190 cm tall, and I weigh almost (yes, almost) 60 kg. <br />
I have blond hair and blue/green/greyish eyes (they change, but I don't know how that works).

**Q: Why are you so much on Discord? Don't you have a life?**
> So if I'm gonna start from the beginning - I didn't have a proper childhood like a usual kid. <br />
I was bullied in middle and high school, and I couldn't do much about it. I'm the kind of guy that can't show hate against enemies. <br />
I've just accepted that I had to go through it and don't look back. That episode in my life left me with no childhood. <br />
**I didn't spend it like other kids.** <br />
But as time went by, people grew up, and I have forgiven my enemies for the mistakes that they made, and just kept going with my life. <br />
Even because of that trauma - I still love going out with people (when I have with who :P) and just basically I like to party and have a good time. <br />
If I would get to choose: **a)** `going out with people somewhere` or **b)** `staying at home, playing more games`, I would choose ***A*** all day. Because where are people - I'm happy.
But I hate people that are showing their wealth. Usually with something like cars, clothes etc. It's just showing that you can afford it. For me - it's just showing that you can afford **this specific item**, nothing more. To me, it looks like hiding your poverty with some expensive thing.

I spent a lot of time in the past researching human thought process, I kinda became a psychologist in some way. It's not like I'm a licensed one, but I will usually know what you have under that skull. :brain:

That also made me kind of a philosopher :thought_balloon:; I love to think what would happen if something happens etc. *Thinking about thinking* XD. That's why I make decent quotes that you can look into if you need some inspiration in life. **They are at the bottom if you wanna check them out.** üîÖ

**I have a tattoo!**
> **I got it at the age of 15.** <br />
Now don't be excited or freaked out, because I did it at so young age, but *it was an accident*. <br />
So to explain it better: *The tattoo is just ink beneath a skin*, and the story behind it is kind of unpleasant, so long story short and say - my little brother did it with a marker üñçÔ∏è **on my eyelid**. He swept at me the tip of the marker on my eyelid, which drew a line on my eyelid, and the divider between the top and bottom half of the marker (the sharp edge) **cut the skin on my eyelid**. It happened in milliseconds because he wanted to hit it really really hard. So right now, as I'm closing my left eye, there is a blue line. Kind of fun, if I say it myself so. It doesn't blur or change my vision, the shot didn't affect my eyesight so there is no need to worry. <br />
There is a possibility to remove it, but there is a high chance of losing eyesight in this eye, so I want to keep it and keep my eyesight, then have a chance to lose in in cost of some blue line. And why would I remove it, if there is a cool story behind it? :DD

I don't watch many films üì∫, but if I do, I mainly watch SciFi / Ficional on Netflix or some cracked websites (like everybody does).

In matter of other media things, I love music üé∏, **and I mean it**. I was a vocalist before the mutation üé§, but since then I play as many instruments as I can (I have an acoustic and electric guitarüé∏, keyboard üéπ and bass guitar) and also I love listening to it üéß. Usually, throughout the day I don't listen to it a lot, but when I'm leaving my house to get somewhere, **I usually listen to one song over and over again** üîÇ. Just a preference.

I'm a student at the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology (second year) üéì.

I have undiagnosed ADHD. That means, that I have most (for me **every**) possible symptom of [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) (loss of focus, hyperactivity etc.). That basically means throughout the day I tend to lose focus and can't do much anymore because I'm getting distracted really quickly. That usually comes up as just losing focus on a talk or just basically stopping listening to anybody. In games that look like a "I don't care about it anymore" or "IDGAF about that game"
But ADHD made me obsessed with having clean in my room (items and clothes having in the designated place, not like dust), or by using a better term: a perfectionist. I have to set up my keyboard perpendicularly to my mousepad and usually at the Uni have a tablet exactly in the middle of the desk. That comes to my desktop being clean and grouped up in categories.
Because I know I have ADHD I usually organise my time as much as possible with what I will be doing.

I'm not much of a drinker üçæ, so I started drinking at 18, and stopped at 18 (I hadn't touched alcohol in my life before 18).

I have a cat üêà. His name is Goldi (from gold hair of course) and he turned 7 in July.

I'm a minimalist. I don't need much for life (especially when it comes to vacations) so gifts for me are usually kind of useless. I would have rather more time spent with someone important to me eg. birthdays than a gift.
When it comes to birthdays - I hate mine with passion. It's just a day when you get a little of attention from another person and it's not because they want it to give it to you, it's just a human habit. And every one of them is just a reminder that, that many people know you, but they just don't care about you.

As you know - I love people, and I believe in them (as a religion). I'm technically a Christian, but I believe in human behavior and decision-making more than God's miracles. But I respect other people's beliefs - and if you want to tell me more about it - I'm all ears. I just want to know - what is the difference between me and you.

If you gonna be kinda into me - stop it. I'm single, but I don't believe in love through the Internet. And don't even try it with me. Friendship is all I can give.
But if you wanna know more about *that side of me*, I'm a bit of a romantic with a constant need of affirmation that I'm doing things right, and my partner is enjoying them. And even if I can trust with my heart doesn't mean I always trust like fully. It's just my constant fear of being betrayed, even if the second person is more loyal than me. It's just trauma, and I can't help it.


## About my "internet side"

So **I'm Mudxiej_**, you don't say it as you see it (mud ks iej), more rather Mudziej, with a **Z** (mu J ej)

Before I say anything more - I wanna add that I'm the same person on the internet as in real life. I don't go there with a mask, because it's just useless for me :P.

I'm into video games like Valorant, Minecraft, and LoL for 2 months so I'm still new I shall say.

I love red color üü• and it's my main color in life. Like everybody has their favourite color - mine is red. You wear red - I will be more focused than anyone else.

When it comes to Minecraft - I had my own server by name NetheriteSMP. <br/> 
I had done some videos [on my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mudxiej_), but I abandoned it, because I hate editing, and I don't have money to hire an editor for these low-quality videos.

I'm really into PC stuff like a software engineer, so if you have any problems - I think I can solve it. Not like a bug that can be solved only by developers but just usual stuff (like accessing back your hacked account, or just general IT questions)

Also, I do some videos on YT (from time to time), stream sometimes on Twitch üî¥, and make some random content on TikTok (not on my main channel, hidden one).

I'm a moderator on the 3D Aim Trainer server (mostly known for), and I was a moderator on [Chezjusz](https://www.youtube.com/c/Chezjusz) server (the 60-year-old guy who is still recording classic Minecraft videos, like back in a day).

If you would be wondering about my gaming setup, I have it on my [twitch](https://twitch.tv/mudxiej_) in the description. Feel free to check it out.

I don't swear that much. I don't rage at video games and I just enjoy games the way we should - with fun, not competitive hate about being bat at the game. That's my point of view in LoL.

My trademark on the internet is to add a second smile to the emoji like ":))" or ":DD". It's just a preference.

### My own quotes:
> These quotes are usually found in my Discord profile "About me"
<br/>

*I've been hurt, broken and left, beyond aid. <br />
That's why I'll make sure others won't receive the same pain I've gained*  <br />

<br />

*Single, but not looking...  <br />
Bc you know what's funny about love :heart: ?  <br />
The Love is going to find you, not the other way. <br />
So don't look for it. Stay and wait :))*  <br />

<br />

*If you don't see the happiness  <br />
In the end - ask yourself:  <br />
"Is it worth reaching for this goal?;  <br />
Is the sacrifice worth your happiness?"*  <br />

<br />

*If she cheats, and won't show you that she loves you,   <br />
till the last drop of the sweat, don't go back.  <br />
But if she does show you how much she changed after what she did,  <br />
to have your trust back - let her in your heart again.*  <br />

*Because, do you remember how you fell when you were learning to walk?  <br />
You made a mistake. And you never did it again.  <br />
Learning from mistakes makes us stronger.  <br />
We may stumble along the way, but that won't unlearn how to walk.  <br />
Keep on walking and don't forget who you love.*  <br />

<br />

*Treasure the love you've built, <br />
like creators value what they made.* <br />

<br />

*I value others, <br />
before my life.* <br />

<br />

*I don't deal pain to the others <br />
I'm not like the others <br />
I bring happiness* <br />

<br />

*I'm happiest when you understand me <br />
for who I am* <br />

<br />

*I'm not running away from problems, <br />
because I'm afraid of you or your opinion about me. <br />
I'm running because I have a power to kill people <br />
because of the pain from the past, <br />
and I don't want to hurt you. <br />
I would never hurt you* <br />

<br />
